I have taken custom dataset from roboflow platform make a person detection model. The accuracy of the detection model is 92% in 50 epochs.
Next I applied "ByteTrack" tracker algorithm to track the person with unique ID within in the frame. I have tested 5 vedios which is attached in the folder.

I have used ultralytics library to train and test the model faster on tracking objection in vedios.
